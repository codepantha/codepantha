### Hi there, I'm Promise 👋 👨‍💻

![My Readme Banner](ezeprom.png)

I'm a full-stack software developer who is passionate about creating useful technology to make our everyday lives much easier. Some technologies I love working with include Javascript, Node.js, ReactJS and Redux. I love learning and I'm currently improving my ReactJS skills after which I would definitely learn React Native for mobile development.
